# Design QA

## Visual Grounding

- Selected ImageGen direction: `design/visual-options/redaction-room.png`.
- Implemented picker capture: `design/captures/picker-390x844.png`.
- Implemented live event capture: `design/captures/event-390x844.png`.
- Implemented result capture: `design/captures/result-390x844.png`.
- The selected reference and picker implementation were inspected together at the same mobile viewport before the event and result screens were completed.

## Browser Checks

- Viewport: 390 x 844.
- Picker: one primary historical card, neighboring-card hint, five-era rail, and shuffle are visible without horizontal overflow.
- Event: stable scene crop, 12-node rail, deviation meter, four world metrics, and all three AI choices render together without overlap or vertical page scrolling.
- Result: 390 px capture node width equals its scroll width; document client width equals document scroll width, so there is no horizontal overflow.
- Export: verified real PNG at 780 x 2686 with no clipped timeline, causal chain, balance, or footer content.
- Typography, borders, color accents, spacing, and image crops remain consistent with the selected coal/newsprint archive direction.

## Functional Checks

- Completed a real 11-decision DeepSeek `deepseek-v4-flash` run from the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis through the alternate 2026 result.
- Verified the final node contains exactly 11 history records and uses the generated 2026 city scene.
- Verified deterministic deviation reached 94 without the former post-chapter-five reset.
- Verified era navigation changes the active starting card and starts a different historical simulation.
- Verified a reload during node generation automatically resumes to a three-choice event without showing the interruption screen.
- Verified malformed model structure repairs, regenerates, or falls back locally while transport/authentication errors remain retryable.
- Verified native share/download fallback and actual PNG creation.
- Verified mute, retry, restart, era switching, three-choice decisions, and alternate-present actions.

## Final Result

Final result: passed.
# Butterfly Relay QA (2026-07-14)

- 390 × 844: full history archive renders 50 selectable rows with no horizontal overflow.
- Real DeepSeek opening generated identity relay, profile advantage, and exactly one profile-powered action.
- All three opening choices fit above y=650 in an 844px viewport.
- After increasing the turn response budget from 1100 to 1600 tokens and tightening copy limits, a real chapter-six continuation completed in one API request.
- Real path observed distinct roles and topics: engineering centurion → records clerk → courier translator → local accountant → school teacher → mint deputy supervisor.
- Active run exit control is visible at 14px,14px and covered by integration tests.
